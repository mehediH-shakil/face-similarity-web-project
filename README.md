# Face Similarity Web Project

This web project utilizes HTML, CSS, Django, and machine learning to provide a face similarity verification system. The system employs the `face_recognition` library for face recognition and verification, along with a trained model file to perform similarity checks.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The project utilizes HTML to create the structure and layout of the web pages. HTML ensures proper rendering and presentation of the user interface elements.

- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to enhance the visual appeal of the web pages. CSS provides styling and customization options to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.

- Django: The project is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework. Django facilitates rapid development, follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, and provides various features like URL routing, template rendering, and database handling.

- SQLite: The web project employs SQLite, a lightweight and easy-to-use relational database management system. SQLite is integrated with Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to store and retrieve data efficiently.

- Machine Learning: The core functionality of the project revolves around machine learning. The `face_recognition` library is utilized for face verification, while a trained model file is used for face similarity checks. The model is trained on a dataset to identify facial features and compute similarity scores accurately.

## Functionality

1. Face Verification: The web project allows users to upload an image and verify if it contains a face or not. The `face_recognition` library is employed to detect and recognize faces in the uploaded image.

2. Face Similarity Check: Users can upload two images and determine the similarity between the faces in the images. The trained model file is utilized to compare the facial features and provide a similarity score.

3. User Management: The web application includes user management features. Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. User authentication and authorization are handled securely using Django's built-in authentication system.

4. Database Integration: The project integrates SQLite with Django's ORM to store user information, uploaded images, and other relevant data. The database ensures persistent storage and retrieval of data, providing a seamless user experience.

## Deployment

The web project can be deployed on various platforms, such as Heroku, AWS, or a local server. It requires the installation of Python, Django, and other necessary dependencies. Detailed deployment instructions and configuration guidelines can be found in the project's documentation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Django development server using the appropriate command.
4. Access the web application through your preferred web browser.
5. Register an account or log in if you already have one.
6. Follow the instructions provided on the web pages to perform face similarity checks.
7. Enjoy the face similarity system and explore the additional features provided.

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time Face Detection: Implement real-time face detection using computer vision techniques and a webcam. This would allow users to verify and compare faces in live video streams.

2. Cloud Storage Integration: Integrate the web application with cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage) to securely store and manage user-uploaded images.

3. Advanced Similarity Metrics: Enhance the similarity checking algorithm by incorporating advanced metrics and techniques, such as deep learning-based face embedding models, to achieve more accurate and robust face similarity scores.

4. User Feedback and Reporting: Implement user feedback and reporting mechanisms to gather user suggestions, report issues, and improve the system based on user input.
